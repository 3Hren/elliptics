This directory contains example applications suitable for IO storage usage or as
a guide for own storage system development based on the elliptics network project.

ioserv.c
Feature-rich IO server and client capable of storing data (i.e. being part of the
network) and being a simple reading/writing client. It works with local files
as basic objects to be stored/loaded to/from the network. Application supports
redundant writes and uses OpenSSL hash functions as transformation entities.
Requires OpenSSL development library (autodetected at configuration time).

hparser.c
Transaction history parser - dumps decoded update log optionally highlighting
transactions which touched requested data area (offset/size) in the last column.

iotest.c
Massive parallel IO testing utility.
While being rather simple and a bit ugly, it still solves the problem of spreading
of the single object over the network with ability to store/load parts of the object
in parallel. Used for IO stress testing of the elliptics network by creating huge
object equally spread over the cloud and performing parallel random reading of the
transactions.

stat.c
Statistics gathering utility. Can show load average, disk and memory statistics.

notify.c
Notification subsystem client. Can show update transactions for given objects.

file_backend.c tc_backend.c
IO storage backends.

hash.c
Hash transformation functions (including sync-to-neighbour 'prevN' function).
